Comparison of Multinomial Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine Classifiers 

  

### Description 

This Python script compares the performance of three different machine learning classifiers - Multinomial Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - on a text classification task. The script loads the training and test data, trains the classifiers, and evaluates their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrices for each classifier are also generated and saved as images. 

  

### Prerequisites 

- Python 3.x 

- NumPy 

- Scikit-learn 

- Seaborn 

- Matplotlib 

  

### Installation 

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. 

2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command: 

   ``` 

   pip install numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib 

   ``` 

  

### Usage 

1. Place the following files in the same directory as the Python script: 

   - `trainMatrixModified.txt` 

   - `testMatrixModified.txt` 

   - `trainClasses.txt` 

   - `testClasses.txt` 

   - `modifiedterms.txt` 

2. Run the Python script using the following command: 

   ``` 

   python script.py 

   ``` 

3. The script will output the accuracy scores for each classifier and generate the following files: 

   - `NB_CM.png`: Confusion matrix for the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier 

   - `KNN_CM.png`: Confusion matrix for the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier 

   - `SVM_CM.png`: Confusion matrix for the Support Vector Machine classifier 

   - `KNN_EM.png`: Evaluation metrics for the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier 

   - `NB_EM.png`: Evaluation metrics for the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier 

   - `SVM_EM.png`: Evaluation metrics for the Support Vector Machine classifier 

   - `NB.txt`: Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix for the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier 

   - `KNN.txt`: Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix for the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier 

   - `SVM.txt`: Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix for the Support Vector Machine classifier
